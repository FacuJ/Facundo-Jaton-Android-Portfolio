I'm a software developer specialized in Android Apps with Kotlin and I have also developed websites associated with them. I also have a background in electronics studies, but after my first automation, electronics and software development projects, I realized that my passion was in writing high-quality code and making my contribution to society through applications that solve specific problems, apply the newest technologies and make people's lives easier.
