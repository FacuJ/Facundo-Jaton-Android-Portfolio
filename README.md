<br/>

I'm a software developer specialized in Android Apps with Kotlin and I have also developed websites associated with
them. I have a background in electronics studies too, but after my first automation, electronics and software
development projects, I realized that my passion was in writing high-quality code and making my contribution through
apps that solve specific problems, apply the newest technologies and make people's lives easier.

## Experience

Working on [AutoSolve](https://www.autosolve.com.ar/#/), which is my own Startup, since 2018. Developed over 10 Android
Apps, all of them in Kotlin and 4 Websites with Vue.js and Quasar. Backends with Firebase
